
JasperReports Library 6.7.0 Change Log
=============================================

- repository context concept added to the repository access API in order to support use 
of relative paths within the repository to reference reporting resources such as subreports, 
images, style templates, resource bundles and other;

- the optional artifacts such as the chart themes, chart customizers, functions and fonts, 
which were previously built out of samples, have been moved to the new /ext folder inside the 
project source tree;

has been added to the /ext folder as an optional artifact and can be tested using the sample 
inside the /demo/samples/customvisualization folder;
